netbeans-project-switcher
=========================

Presents one single project of the projects tree.

Using Netbeans I found it alway hard to navigate through the projects tree. 
Especially with many open tree nodes, you have to scroll backwards and forward to find 
the node you need.

This plugin offers a simple project navigator, that only presents one project. The visible 
project is choosen from a combobox.
